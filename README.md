The code you've provided is for a Tic Tac Toe game built using Python and Tkinter, featuring a basic AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm. Here's a breakdown of how the game works:

### Overview:
- **Game Board:** The board is represented as a 3x3 grid using a dictionary, where each key (1-9) corresponds to a position on the grid.
- **Player and AI Moves:** The player chooses between "X" and "O" and takes turns with the AI to place their marks on the board.
- **AI Logic:** The AI uses the minimax algorithm to decide its moves, aiming to either win the game or force a draw.
- **Winning and Drawing Conditions:** The game checks for wins or draws after each move and displays the result using a message box.

### Code Explanation:

1. **Board Representation:**
   - The board is a dictionary where each key corresponds to a position (1-9), and the value is either `"X"`, `"O"`, or `" "` (empty).

2. **Functions:**
   - `space_is_empty(position)`: Checks if a given position on the board is empty.
   - `checkDraw()`: Returns `True` if all positions on the board are filled, leading to a draw.
   - `checkForWin(mark)`: Checks if the given mark (`"X"` or `"O"`) has a winning combination.
   - `insertLetter(letter, position)`: Places the player's or AI's mark on the board and checks for a win or draw.
   - `comp_move()`: Determines the best move for the AI using the minimax algorithm.
   - `minimax(isMaximizing)`: Recursively evaluates potential moves to find the optimal strategy for the AI.

3. **Player Input and Game Flow:**
   - The player chooses their mark (`"X"` or `"O"`) using a message box.
   - The game starts when the player clicks on an empty button in the grid.
   - After each move, the game checks if the player or AI has won, or if the game is a draw.
   - The game resets after a win or draw.

4. **Tkinter GUI:**
   - A 3x3 grid of buttons represents the game board.
   - Each button is associated with a command that triggers when clicked, allowing the player to make their move.
   - The AI's move is displayed by updating the corresponding button's text.

5. **Reset Functionality:**
   - `resetGame()`: Resets the board and buttons for a new game after a win or draw.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Single Player Mode:** Face off against a smart AI.
- **AI with Minimax Algorithm:** The computer opponent makes optimal moves, providing a challenging experience.
- **Graphical Interface:** Enjoy the game through a clean and intuitive interface built with Tkinter.
- **Game Outcomes:** Know instantly if you‚Äôve won, lost, or drawn the match!

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** (included with Python)

## üöÄ How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
   cd your_repository_name
   ```

2. **Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```

3. **Start Playing:**
   - A dialog box will prompt you to choose your mark: X or O.
   - Click on the buttons in the grid to place your mark.
   - Watch as the AI makes its move and strategize to win!
   - The game will announce the winner or declare a draw when the game ends.

## üé≤ How the Game Works
- **Player Move:** Select your position by clicking on an empty button.
- **AI Move:** The AI uses the minimax algorithm to calculate the best move.
- **Win/Draw:** The game ends when either player wins, or all positions are filled, resulting in a draw.
